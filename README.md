A project for exploratory data visualization to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. 

# My Observations

## 1. Change in analysis direction: Comparing daytime data with nighttime data.

## 2. The traffic at night is generally light so we'll only focus on the daytime data moving forward.
